# first-game-alejandra
my first game using a tutorial by godot docs!
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html

Credits any assets you used
freepngimg.com for all the kirby running
animation hub - fandom for jumping kirby
wikirby for idle kirby
the noun project for blob star
josefpres on freesound.org for music
EVretro on freesound.org for game over sound
Daydream Font by DoubleGum on Dafont.com

the tutorial took be about 3-4 hours, on top of the 1.5 hours of debuggung, and 1 hour spent on deciding and implementing changes.

the following changes were made: changed the music and game over sounds, changed the enemies and player, changed the font that was used.

ASSIGNMENT 2: LOOP IMPLEMENTATION

I added a sink, which was health/damage recieved when clashing with the mobs. This roughly took me about ~30mins to implement. The faucet that I added was a coin drop, which adds up at the top of the screen. This one took me about ~2 hours (along with debugging so the game would actually run), however it doesn't always work when I play it. Finally, I added a level up feature that levels up after a certain amount of time. After 15 seconds, if the player is still alive, they will make it to level 2.
